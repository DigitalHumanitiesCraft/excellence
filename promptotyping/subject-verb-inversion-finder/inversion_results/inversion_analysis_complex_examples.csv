( n182 ) <p> Utilities facing state opposition to expanded on-site storage have also begun to pursue the development of private , off-site storage facilities. ( n183 ) A consortium of utilities has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license to build a private storage facility on the Goshute Indian reservation in Utah.

numeric_inversion,"Regulation of Electric Utilities <p> The electric industry has been regulated since the turn of the 20th century. ( n6 ) One reason for regulating the electric industry is that electric utilities are considered "" natural monopolies . "" ( n7 ) A natural monopoly is one that has an economy of scale. ( n8 ) An economy of scale exists when a single company has the lowest cost of production because the more the company produces , the less expensive it is for the company to produce. ( n9 ) Thus , economies of scale preclude competition because a single company can supply the entire market demand at a lower cost than could two or more companies supplying the market. ( n10 ) Regulation of natural monopolies is therefore necessary ( or so goes the theory ) to reduce the cost of providing the energy . <p> Another theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would waste resources. ( n11 ) In the early 1900s , the utilities competed for customers. ( n12 ) This competition created not only a potential for complete duplication of infrastructure ( because every utility would have its own generating stations , power distribution network , and so on ) , but also a potential for systems that were not compatible. ( n13 ) However , the movement toward deregulation has rejected this theory because proponents of deregulation believe that competition will lower the costs of supplying electricity. ( n14 ) <p> Thus , the result of regulation is a "" monopoly , "" ( n15 ) otherwise known as a "" regulatory bargain "" or "" compact "" ( n16 ) that grants a utility certain rights in exchange for certain obligations. ( n17 ) A public utility 's first right under regulation is to collect a reasonable rate for its service.

( n25 ) Fourth , utilities are obligated to charge no more than "" just and reasonable "" prices for the service they provide.
