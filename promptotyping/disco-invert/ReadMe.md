# DISCO-INVERT

### Comparing Ditransitive Structures, Indirect-object Shift, and Negative Subject-Auxiliary Inversion in English Corpora



## Project Overview

**DISCO-INVERT** is a corpus-based linguistic project analyzing two key syntactic phenomena in English:

* **Ditransitive and Indirect-object shift constructions**
* **Negative and restrictive subject-auxiliary inversion**

The project investigates syntactic patterns, their frequency, and contextual usage within spoken and written corpora of contemporary and historical American English.

## Syntactic Structures Analyzed

### 1. **Ditransitive vs. Indirect-object Shift**

* **Ditransitive (double object)**

  ```
  The waiter gave [Mary]_INDIRECT OBJECT [a drink]_DIRECT OBJECT.
  ```

* **Indirect-object shift (dative movement)**

  ```
  The waiter gave [a drink]_DIRECT OBJECT [to Mary]_INDIRECT OBJECT.
  ```

*Corpus used:* Fisher Corpus (telephone conversations)

### 2. **Negative and Restrictive Subject-Auxiliary Inversion**

Inversion triggered by fronted negative or restrictive elements, changing the canonical order from Subject–Auxiliary to Auxiliary–Subject.

**Included Structures:**

* Negative/restrictive adverbials:

  ```
  Seldom had she visited.
  Nowhere does he mention this.
  At no time must the door be left unlocked.
  ```

* Negative/restrictive objects:

  ```
  Not a single book had he read.
  Only two of them did he find useful.
  ```

**Explicitly Excluded:**

* Inversion with *nor, neither, not only*:

  ```
  Nor do I. Neither do they.
  Not only does he travel...
  ```

*Corpora used:* Fisher Corpus, COCA, COHA

## Contextual Overview (Other Inversion Types)

For comparative reference, the analysis briefly addresses related syntactic inversion phenomena:

* **Interrogatives:**
  `Did she go?`, `Where did she go?`

* **Conditional inversions:**
  `Had I known...`, `Should you change your plans...`

* **Exclamatives:**
  `Boy did she go!`, `What a fool have I been!`

* **Comparative constructions:**
  `She enjoys music, as do I.`

* **Elliptical clauses:**
  `So does he.`, `Neither do they.`

* **Degree expressions (so/such):**
  `So little time did we have...`

## Objectives

* Identify and classify syntactic patterns systematically.
* Analyze syntactic variation across spoken and written English.
* Contribute empirical insights to syntactic theory.

## Corpora

* Fisher Corpus (spoken English)
* Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)
* Corpus of Historical American English (COHA)

## Audience

Researchers in linguistics, corpus linguistics, and syntax.
