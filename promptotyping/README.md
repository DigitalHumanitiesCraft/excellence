# Promptotyping

> Combining prompt engineering with rapid prototyping for data-driven frontend development

## What is Promptotyping?

Promptotyping is an innovative approach to software development that leverages generative AI to streamline the creation of data-driven frontend applications. It bridges the gap between prompt engineering and rapid prototyping, making complex data visualization development more efficient and user-centered.

## Key Features

- üöÄ **AI-Powered Design**: Uses generative AI to quickly create formal sketches for frontend designs and technical specifications
- üìä **Data-Focused**: Specializes in creating interfaces for complex data visualization and research datasets
- üîÑ **Rapid Development**: Incorporates Extreme Programming principles accelerated by AI-generated code suggestions
- üìù **Enhanced Communication**: Uses concise data descriptions (in Markdown) to improve collaboration between data experts and developers
- üéØ **User-Centered**: Emphasizes creating intuitive interfaces for complex data visualization

## Core Components

1. **Requirements Specification**
